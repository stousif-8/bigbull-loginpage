          Jhunjhunwala was born on 5 July 1960 and grew up in a Rajasthani
          Marwari family, in Bombay (now Mumbai), where his father worked as a
          Commissioner of Income Tax; his surname indicates that his ancestors
          hailed from Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan.<sup>[4]</sup> He graduated from
          Sydenham College and subsequently enrolled at the Institute of
          Chartered Accountants of India.

          Jhunjhunwala developed an interest in the stock market after listening
          to his father discuss it with his friends. While his father guided him
          on the markets, he never gave him money to invest and forbade him from
          asking friends for money. With his savings at hand, Jhunjhunwala
          invested ₹5,000 in 1985. That same year, the Sensex was at 150;
          it now trades at over 59,000 points.

          He made his first big profit in 1986 when he bought 5,000 shares of
          Tata Tea at ₹43, and the stock rose to ₹143 within three months. He
          earned over three times his capital. In three years he earned ₹20-25
          lakh.<sup>[5]</sup> Jhunjhunwala's stocks fell by up to 30% in
          December 2011<sup>[6]</sup> but recovered their value later.

          In 1987, he married Rekha Jhunjhunwala, who is also a stock market
          investor. He had three children. Jhunjhunwala's health declined in the
          years prior to his death, in part due to diabetes. He was bound to a
          wheelchair<sup>[10]</sup> and had acute multiple organ failure prior
          to his death on 14 August 2022, at the age of 62.<sup>[3]</sup>
